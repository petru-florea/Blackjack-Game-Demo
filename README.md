### Game rules
Blackjack is one of the easiest card games to play:
+ Cards 2 through 10 have a value written on them, while figures **(J, Q, K)** have a value of 10, the ace **(A)** can have a value of 1 or 11.
+ Players play against a person called **the Dealer** and in order to win they must have a higher number of cards than the dealer. If the sum of the cards exceeds the value **21** the player loses. If the dealer exceeds the value **21**, then everyone present at the table wins, except those who have exceeded **21** before the dealer.
+ Each player receives 2 cards at the beginning, and the dealer also receives 2 cards, but one is reversed (**ATTENTION!** In the real game of Blackjack each player receives one card at a time, to **simplify** the problem, we will consider that the players receive the 2 cards from the get go, and the dealer is the last person to receive the 2 cards).
+ After the cards have been dealt, each player has the right to draw a card **(HIT)** or to stop at the amount he already has **(STAND)**. Players can draw as many cards as they want, but if they exceed 21 they lose (**ATTENTION!** For simplicity we will consider the following scenario: If the sum of the dealer's or player's cards is less than 16, they are required to draw a card. If the sum of the cards is between 17 and 21, they must stop drawing cards. If the amount is more than 21 they lost).
